## 🛠️ Our Projects

We specialize in immersive, Create-driven modpacks and supporting mods with a focus on progression, performance, and artistic presentation. Here are some of our flagship projects:

### 🔧 [Create - Forge Frontier](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-forge-frontier)  
A feature-rich, Create-centric modpack focused on engineering, exploration, and advanced automation using Forge. Packed with custom integrations, performance optimizations, and an evolving quest system.

### 🧱 [Forge Frontier Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-frontier-core)  
A foundational mod built to support the Forge Frontier modpack. Provides custom blocks, fluids, integration hooks, and visual polish tailored to Create-based automation and modded gameplay systems.

### 🌿 [Landscapes Reimagined: Genesis](https://landscapesreimagined.wiki.gg/wiki/Landscapes_Reimagined:_Genesis)  
Our Fabric-based, terrain-focused survival modpack that celebrates world generation, survival mechanics, and visual beauty, built on the foundation of mods like Terralith and Create.
