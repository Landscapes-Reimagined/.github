A feature-rich, Create-centric modpack focused on engineering, exploration, and advanced automation using Forge. Packed with custom integrations, performance optimizations, and an evolving quest system.

### 🌿 [Landscapes Reimagined: Genesis](https://modrinth.com/modpack/landscapes-reimagined-genesis)
Our Fabric-based, terrain-focused survival modpack that celebrates world generation, survival mechanics, and visual beauty, built on the foundation of mods like Terralith and Create.
